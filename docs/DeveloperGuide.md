### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T14-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/arb/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T14-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/arb/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete-client 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="594" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T14-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/arb/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T14-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/arb/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T14-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Client`, `Project` and `TagMapping` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T14-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/arb/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a client).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete-client 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete-client 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteClientCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse an user input, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddClientCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddClientCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddClientCommandParser`, `DeleteClientCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T14-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/arb/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Client` object stores a few pieces of data as separate objects, some of which are optional, as shown in the diagram below. (These details were omitted from the model class diagram.)
<img src="images/ClientClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Project` object stores a few pieces of data as separate objects, some of which are optional, as shown in the diagram below. (These details were omitted from the model class diagram.)
<img src="images/ProjectClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `TagMapping` objects stores a `Tag` object and how many `Client` and `Project` objects it belongs to, as shown in the diagram below. (These details were omitted from the model class diagram.)<br>
<img src="images/TagMappingClassDiagram.png" width="120" height="150" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data: all `Client` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueClientList` object), all `Project` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueProjectList` object), and all `TagMapping` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueTagMappingList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Client` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list, and stores the currently 'sorted' `Client` objects (e.g., results of a sort query) as a separate _sorted_ list. Both lists are exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Client>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Project` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list, and stores the currently 'sorted' `Project` objects (e.g., results of a sort query) as a separate _sorted_ list. Both lists are exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Project>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T14-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/arb/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="600" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `arb.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Projects

#### Implementation
There is a new type of data that can be stored in the application: Projects. These are implemented as a model class, similar to `Client`. They contain information about the project's `Title`, `Status`, `Deadline` (optional), and `Price`(optional), each of which are implemented as separate classes.

A new project can be created using the `add-project`/`ap` command by providing necessary and, optionally, optional details of the project. The project can also be edited for any fields, which will create a new project with the updated details to replace the current one. This also means that project details are guaranteed to be immutable.

Each of the project detail classes have their own validation check that is run upon construction of the object, which is done in the parser (specifically, the `arb.logic.parser.project.AddProjectCommandParser`).

### Sorting

Users have the option to sort visible clients and projects.

#### Implementation
This is facilitated by [JavaFX's `SortedList`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/collections/transformation/SortedList.html), which sorts its contents based on the supplied `Comparator`. As mentioned in the [model](#model-component) section of the architecture overview, the sorted list is exposed to the UI in the form of an unmodifiable `ObservableList`, such that any updates to the sorted list is propagated to the UI.

There are a set of Comparators defined inside the `ModelManager` class, that are supplied to the sorted list depending on how the user wants to sort clients or projects. Example Comparators include comparing names of `Client` objects.

Whenever the user executes a sort command, the model updates the sorted list with the corresponding `Comparator`. The below diagram shows what occurs when a user executes a `sort-client` command, which sorts the client list by name.

<img src="images/SortingSequenceDiagram.png" width="600" />

As the contents of the sorted list is the already filtered list, executing sorting will only sort clients/projects that are currently visible. Clients/projects that are hidden due to a previous `find command` will remain hidden.

#### Alternatives
An alternative would be for sorting to sort all clients/projects instead of only those that are visible, causing sorting commands to show all clients/projects but sorted. We did not go with this implementation as we wanted users to be able to combine the effects of filtering and sorting for better data organisation.

### Linking Projects to Clients

Users have the ability to link projects to clients.

#### Implementation

When parsing the command to add or edit a project, the parser checks for the existence of client name keywords in the command. If it does, then ArB displays a client list filtered with the provided client name keywords, sets the project to be linked and enters link mode, as shown in the sequence diagram below.

<img src="images/LinkingParsingSequenceDiagram.png" width="400" />

In link mode, the user can input an index to link the added/edited project to the specified client, as shown in the sequence diagram below. ArB will then exit link mode and return to normal operations.

<img src="images/LinkingIndexParsingSequenceDiagram.png" width="400" />

Internally, a project can be linked to one client while a client can have multiple linked projects. A client's linked projects are stored in a `UniqueProjectList` object that each `Client` object has. This implementation is shown in the class diagram below.

<img src="images/LinkedClassDiagram.png" width="200" />

For example, the below is an object diagram representing the situation where we have two projects `P1` and `P2` that are both linked to the same `Client` object.

<img src="images/ExampleLinkedObjectDiagram.png" width="200" />

#### Future improvements
Currently, projects are only allowed to be linked to a single client. This was done to avoid introducing too much complexity such that it was feasible to complete this feature before the deadline.

In future, projects could be linked to multiple clients. This could be implemented by storing a list of `Client` objects, perhaps using a `UniqueClientList`. The below class diagram showcases this  implementation.

<img src="images/LinkingAlternateClassDiagram.png" width="300" />

### Better filtering

Users now have the ability to find clients and projects using a greater number of parameters, such as tags and deadlines.

#### Implementation

### Done Status

#### Implementation

The displaying of the "DONE" status is facilitated by the `markAsDone()`
method in the Project class.

The Done status is highlighted in the UI when the project is done.
The ProjectCard class has been updated to run the aforementioned `markAsDone()`
method for any project before setting its status to OVERDUE, DONE, or NOT DONE.

### Not Done Status

#### Implementation

The displaying of the "NOT DONE" status is facilitated by the `markAsUndone()`
method in the Project class.

The Not Done status is highlighted in the UI when the project is not done and not overdue.
The ProjectCard class has been updated to run the aforementioned `markAsUndone()`
method for any project before setting its status to OVERDUE, DONE, or NOT DONE.

### Overdue Status

#### Implementation
The displaying of the "OVERDUE" status is facilitated by the isOverdue method
in the Project class. The isOverdue method returns a boolean after using the
compareTo method in the Deadline class which checks the current date
against the deadline date of the project, i.e. check if a project's deadline
is past the current date.

The Overdue status is highlighted in the UI when any project is past its deadline.
The ProjectCard class has been updated to run the aforementioned isOverdue
method for any project before setting its status to OVERDUE, DONE, or NOT DONE.
The OVERDUE status is shown for existing projects in the list that are overdue, and
if a user adds a project with a deadline with a data that has already past.

### Marking projects

Users have the ability to mark a certain project as DONE.

#### Implementation


### Unmarking projects

Users have the ability to mark a certain project as NOT DONE/OVERDUE.

#### Implementation

### Listing Clients

Users have the ability to list all their clients.

#### Implementation


### Listing Projects

Users have the ability to list all their projects. A summary of how many overdue, done, and not done projects is also displayed.

#### Implementation
