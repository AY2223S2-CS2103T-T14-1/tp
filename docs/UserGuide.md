Artistic addressbook (ArB) is a **desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ArB can get your contact and project management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `arb.jar` from [here](https://github.com/se-edu/artistic addressbook-level3/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your artistic addressbook.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar addressbook.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. The app may contain some sample data if being opened for the first time.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list clients` : Lists all clients.

   * `add name/John Doe phone/98765432 email/johnd@example.com` : Adds a client named `John Doe` to the Artistic addressbook.

   * `delete client 3` : Deletes the 3rd client shown in the current client list.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Syntax

`[ACTION VERB] [options]`

`<Required argument> [optional argument]`

All commands case insensitive

## Prefixes

1. `name/` -> name: name 
2. `email/` -> email: valid email 
3. `phone/` -> phone: valid phone 
4. `deadline/` -> deadline: valid date / date-time
5. `price/` -> price: valid price
6. `client/` -> client: keywords to search for clients to link to a project

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

Prices must be in a recognisable price format, such as `3.08` or `5`.

Clients can be linked by entering individual keywords that are part of the clients name.

### Editing the data file

Artistic addressbook's data is saved as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/arb.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, artistic addressbook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
